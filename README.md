## Getting Started

After downloaded the project, make sure in pubspaec.yaml, quick_blue: ^0.5.0-dev.2, instead of being downgradded to 0.3 by VSCode due to the lastest version of other packages conflict with quick_blue

For building Windows app, Nuget.exe is required. If running with VSCode, open VSCode with Admin.
